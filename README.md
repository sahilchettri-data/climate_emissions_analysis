# Global CO² Emissions Analysis

An exploratory data analysis of global CO² emissions using the Our World in Data dataset, covering 217 countries from 1750 to 2024.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Dataset
Our World in Data CO² and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset via Kaggle, containing 50,000+ rows across 79 variables.

## Project Structure
- notebooks/ — Jupyter notebook with full analysis and visualizations
- images/ — Exported chart images
- data/ — Raw dataset

## Key Findings
China is the largest annual emitter today but the USA has contributed more than any other nation to cumulative historical emissions since 1750, exceeding the combined total of China and Russia. All top 10 countries that have most significantly reduced emissions since 2000 are European, demonstrating that economic development and decarbonization can go hand in hand. Gulf states show the starkest disconnect between wealth and sustainability, while Scandinavian nations prove that high income economies can maintain low carbon footprints.
